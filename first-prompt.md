As a Senior Enginieer (fullstack developer) help me to create a new proyect that containts a folder with the backend, another one with the frontend, and a docker compose configuration to help me to manage the database.

The backend will be implemented with Javascript, using express as web server, and sequelize as ORM and migrations manager. This project will be implemented using best practices like DDD and TDD, so create the structure having into account this.

The frontend will be implemented with Javacript, using the React library, and Boostrap for styles. Create a structure that allows me to implements the frontend apliting the UI components, and pages in different files.

The database will be PostgreSQL and will be managed using a docker compose service.

Help me to start this project and create:
*  An endpoint to test the availability of the backend web server.
*  A web page to check the frontend, this web page will contain a text relative to an "Aplicant tracking system".
* A users model to tests the migrations.

The backend and fronted will use Jest for unit tests.

Also create a Makefile to manage commands like:
* start the backend
* start the fronted
* excute migrations
* other commands that you suggest me that will help me in the future.
